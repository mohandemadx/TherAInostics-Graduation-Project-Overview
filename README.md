## Overview

Prostate cancer remains a leading cause of cancer mortality in men. **Theranostics**, combining diagnostics and targeted therapy, offers a modern solution. Our platform provides:

-  **AI-driven segmentation & classification**
-  **Longitudinal tracking tools**
-  **Web-based DICOM visualization**
-  **Integration of ResNet & UNet models**

---

##  System Architecture

The platform is composed of:

- **PACS Server** â€“ Secure DICOM storage with compression & backups  
- **Study List** â€“ Interface to search, organize, and classify patient scans  
- **Web-based DICOM Viewer** â€“ Compare axial, sagittal, and coronal views + 3D MIP  
- **AI Module** â€“ 
  - Prostate segmentation (Attention UNet)  
  - Lesion classification (3D ResNet50)  
  - Lesion segmentation (3D UNet w/ CT & PET input)  


---

##  Key Features

-  **Interactive DICOM Viewer**  
  Zoom, pan, crosshair, 3D MIP, segmentation tools, slice comparison, and volume trend analysis.

-  **AI-Powered Tasks**  
  - Prostate segmentation using **Attention UNet**
  - Lesion classification with **3D ResNet**
  - Dual-modality lesion segmentation using **3D UNet**

-  **Longitudinal Tracking**  
  Compare multiple time points, track treatment response via tumor volume and tracer uptake.

##  AI Methodologies

###  Prostate Segmentation
- **Dataset**: TCIA â€“ 129 CT studies  
- **Model**: 2D UNet, 3D UNet, Attention UNet  
- **Best Performance**: Attention UNet (Dice = 0.85)  

###  Lesion Classification
- **Dataset**: AutoPET Challenge  
- **Model**: Custom 3D CNN vs ResNet50  
- **Best Performance**: ResNet50 (Accuracy = 73%, Precision = 85%)

###  Lesion Segmentation
- **Input**: Dual-modality (PET + CT)  
- **Model**: 3D UNet  
- **Dice Score**: 0.67 (after post-processing)

##  Results

| Task | Model | Score |
|------|--------|--------|
| Prostate Segmentation | Attention UNet | **0.85 Dice** |
| Lesion Segmentation | 3D UNet | **0.67 Dice** |
| Lesion Classification | ResNet50 | **73% Accuracy** |

 **Post-processing improved lesion segmentation by 4%** using body masking.

##  Limitations & Future Work

-  Current models trained on **FDG PET/CT** datasets, not PSMA  
-  Plan to retrain on **PSMA-labeled datasets** from Misr Radiology Center  
-  Future improvements in segmentation accuracy with more advanced models
